Zillow solution.

This is my first solution in zillow competition. there are a few steps you must follow to run this solution:

1. make sure you place dataset file 'train_2016_v2.csv', 'train_2017.csv', and 'properties_2017.csv' in this folder, you can download them from here 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data'.

2. make sure you change directory name (or path) in all file to this directory. in my system I use this 'D:\\python\\zillow' to place all my code and dataset.

3. run 'run.bat', and wait until all done.

if you succesfully run 'run.bat' you will see some file 'lgb-comb.csv', 'properties_2017.pickle', 'properties_v7_2017', 'lgb-5-cat.csv', and 'lgb-10.csv'

and final solution is 'lgb-comb.csv'.
