Zillow solution 2.

This is my 2nd solution in zillow competition. there are a few steps you must follow to run this solution:

1. make sure you place dataset file 'train_2016_v2.csv', 'train_2017.csv', and 'properties_2017.csv' in this folder, you can download them from here 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data'.

2. make sure you change directory name (or path) in all file to this directory. in my system I use this 'D:\\python\\zillow'

3. run 'run.bat', and wait until all done.
